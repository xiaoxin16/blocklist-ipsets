By using data provided by Ransomware Tracker, hosting- and internet service provider (ISPs) , as well as national CERTs/CSIRTs, law enforcement agencies (LEA)  and security researchers can receive an overview on infrastructure used by Ransomware and whether these are actively being used by miscreants to commit fraud. The IPs in this list have been extracted from the tracker data feed, filtering only online IPs. ",
