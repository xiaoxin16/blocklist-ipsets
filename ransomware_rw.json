	"info": "<a href=\"https://ransomwaretracker.abuse.ch\">Abuse.ch Ransomware Tracker</a>  Ransomware Tracker tracks and monitors the status of domain names, IP addresses and URLs that are associated with Ransomware, such as Botnet C&C servers, distribution sites and payment sites. By using data provided by Ransomware Tracker, hosting- and internet service provider (ISPs) , as well as national CERTs/CSIRTs, law enforcement agencies (LEA)  and security researchers can receive an overview on infrastructure used by Ransomware and whether these are actively being used by miscreants to commit fraud. This list includes TC_PS_IPBL, LY_C2_IPBL, TL_C2_IPBL, TL_PS_IPBL and it is the recommended blocklist. It might not catch everything, but the false positive rate should be low. However, false positives are possible, especially with regards to RW_IPBL. IP addresses associated with Ransomware Payment Sites (*_PS_IPBL)  or Locky botnet C&Cs (LY_C2_IPBL)  stay listed on RW_IPBL for a time of 30 days after the last appearance. This means that an IP address stays listed on RW_IPBL even after the threat has been eliminated (e.g. the VPS / server has been suspended by the hosting provider)  for another 30 days. ",
